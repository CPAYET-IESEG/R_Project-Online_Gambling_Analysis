# R_Project-Online_Gambling_Analysis
You will receive data about an online gambling website. The company is interested in creating knowledge from their databases; however, they are not really sure how to do this. Your task is to provide 1) basic marketing descriptives for the customer base and 2) create a marketing data mart per customer (so a row for each customer and columns contain key marketing metrics for that customer).  Data:  See the documentation file on Github for a detailed description of the data. Be sure that you are familiar with the data before starting the assignment.
