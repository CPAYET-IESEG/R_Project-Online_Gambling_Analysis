# R_Project-Online_Gambling_Analysis
This is data about an online gambling website. The company is interested in creating knowledge from their databases; however, they are not really sure how to do this. YWe have to provide basic marketing descriptives for the customer base and to create a marketing data mart per customer (so a row for each customer and columns contain key marketing metrics for that customer).

Our goal is to create marketing insights from these data. You are going to create a ‘marketing data mart’, in which you capture the important marketing metrics for the betting company. These marketing data are on a customer level, so we will have to create a basetable with one row per customer. The columns should be the different marketing metrics. Examples of marketing metrics are loyalty, consumption, …
Next to this, we want an overall picture on the customers. E.g., where do the customers come from, what is their average age, what type of products do customers buy in specific regions, etc. We want this in a flexible and interactive format, using an R Shiny application.

Output: 
R scripts, with comments so that this is understandable
Create a neat and concise Marketing data manual for marketing analysts, that contains the overall summary statistics that we think are relevant (mainly based on the marketing data mart, but can also include other interesting descriptive figures) and also gives a detailed description of the gamblers’ metrics calculated.
A Shiny application, which provides interactive features to investigate the marketing numbers
